2016-11-20    VERSION 2.4
    * Fix compatibility with nginx-1.7.12+.
    * explain the purge logic
    * feat(purge all): Include option to purge all the cached files
      This option can be slow if a lot of content is cached, or if the
      storage used for the cache is slow. But you really should be using
      RAM as your cache storage.
    * feat(partial keys): Support partial keys to purge multiple keys.
      Put an '*' at the end of your purge cache URL.
      e.g:
          proxy_cache_key $scheme$host$uri$is_args$args$cookie_JSESSIONID;
          curl -X PURGE https://example.com/pass*
      This will remove every cached page whose key cache starting with:
          httpsexample.com/pass*
      Be careful not passing any value for the values after the $uri, or put
      it at the end of your cache key.
    * Convert a config file to build a dynamic module

      Reported by MagicBear, patch from Ruslan Ermilov.

2011-12-20    VERSION 1.5
    * Fix on-disk cache size calculation.
      Since the initial release, recorded on-disk cache size was
      decreased twice for purged content (once during cache purge
      and once during subsequent cache update).
      This resulted in recorded on-disk cache size being much
      smaller than in reality, which could lead to on-disk cache
      outgrowing defined "max_size" parameter.
      Patch from Pyry Hakulinen.
